						kiddos; Ginger (12), Brigham (8), Hazel (6), and 
						Clementine (23 months). I have an A.S. in Film and 
						Video Production FullSail and I’m currently working 
						on a bachelor's degree in Web Development with a minor 
						in Design. I have way too many hobbies; board games 
						and rubik’s cube are just a few on the more prominent 
						ones. I used to  work at a video production company 
						for about 10 years. I did a bit of everything there 
						from lighting and camera work to editing shows, motion 
						graphics, and special effects. I currently work for a 
						Native American Tribe as an IT Trainer in the IT Dept. 
						I create training materials for the staff about the 
						proprietary software we use to manage the social 
						services program we run. I’m planning to use my 
						bachelors degree to become a teacher. My wife is a 
						teacher and I want to take summers off with her and 
						the kids. I’ve been getting really interested in 
						mobile app development lately. It the little moments 
						of free time I get, I’ve been working through some 
						online courses on Swift and Xcode.

                    <p>Hello there, I'm Alex. I live in Southern California... not at 
                        the beach though, I wish! I'm married to an amazing
                        woman named Darcie and we have 4 fantastic kiddos;
                        Ginger, Brigham, Hazel, 
                        and Clementine. I have a Liberal Arts A.A. 
                        from a local college out here and an A.S. in Film and 
                        Video Production from an “accredited” school in Florida.
                        I have way too many hobbies; board games, and rubik’s 
                        cube are just a few on the more prominent ones. I’m 
                        planning to use my bachelors degree to become a teacher.
                        My wife is a teacher and I want to take summers off with
                        her and the kids. I’m majoring in Web Development with a
                        minor in Design. I currently work in the IT dept. of a 
                        Native American tribe where I develop online training 
                        modules for the employees. I'm slowly teaching myself 
                        Swift on the side because I plan to develop iOS apps. I 
                        have some experience with HTML and CSS outside of the 
                        classroom, but I'm no pro. I'm here to learn. If I had 
                        to decide, I'd say I'm currently better with design, but 
                        I'm really trying to focus on improving my dev 
                        skills.</p>
